step1:start
step2:Input nNum from the user and declare a variable called rem
step3:Read nNum
step4:Initalise rev=0
step5:while nNum is greater than or equal to 1 go to step6 else go to step10
step6:calculate rem=nNum%10
step7:calculate rev=(10*rev)+rem
step8:compute nNum=nNum/10
step9:Return rev value
step10:Display the reverse digit,rev
step11:End
